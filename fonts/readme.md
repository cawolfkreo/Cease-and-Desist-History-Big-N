# These fonts are't made by me
I looked up for fonts for the website using dafont and then I found the "pretendo" font [on a forum post](https://www.dafont.com/es/forum/read/26850/the-nintendo-font). I followed the link to [this website](https://www.abstractfonts.com/font/11800?text=Nintendo) and downloaded said font. Apparently, it doesn't appear to have any license so I decided to use this one, just to avoid any "potential legal issues".

For the second font a friend suggested me [the FF Mark font](https://es.bestfonts.pro/font/ff-mark) and I followed the "installation" process to include it on the website. The downside is that now there is a big font folder but I'm not going to think too much about this, hopefully the font loads quickly for everybody, if not, I might have to revisit this in the future and update the fonts.
